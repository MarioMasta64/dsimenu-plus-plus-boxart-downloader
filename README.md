# dsimenu-plus-plus-boxart-downloader

files needed:
* boxart_downloader.bat (main file)
* wget.exe (for downloading)
* readbytesraw.py (for reading the title id from a rom if you didnt dump it with gm9 naming structure)
* select_folder.vbs (optional: download to enable a folder select dialog instead of text-based entry)

files you can create to do things:
* deepfry.txt (does nothing atm)
* direct.txt (writes boxart directly to boxart location, not recommended on slow connections)
* overwrite.txt (wipe boxart directories, used for testing but if you have a use go ahead)
* debug.txt (for me not you)

run the .bat when ready and follow directions
